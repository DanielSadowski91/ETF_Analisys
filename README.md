1. **Calculating Daily Returns and Volatility** :

* The code calculates daily returns for each ETF using the percentage change in the 'Close' prices.
* Annualized volatility is calculated for each ETF using the standard deviation of daily returns multiplied by the square root of 252 (assuming 252 trading days in a year).
* A bar plot is created to visualize the volatility of each ETF.

1. **Calculating and Visualizing Correlation Matrix** :

* The code calculates the correlation matrix between daily returns of different ETFs.
* The correlation matrix is visualized as a heatmap, showing the correlation values between ETF pairs.

1. **Calculating and Analyzing Price Differences** :

* The code calculates the price difference and percentage difference between the first and last closed prices for each ETF.
* The percentage difference is calculated as `(last_closed_price - first_closed_price) / first_closed_price * 100`.
* The ETF name and price difference are printed.

1. **Plotting Individual Return Analysis** :

* For each ETF, the code calculates and plots simple returns, logarithmic returns, and cumulative returns.
* Two subplots are created for each ETF: one for simple returns and one for cumulative returns.
* Simple returns are calculated as the percentage change between 'Open' and 'Close' prices.
* Logarithmic returns are calculated using the logarithm of the ratio of 'Close' to 'Open' prices.
* Cumulative returns are calculated as the cumulative product of (1 + simple return) over time.

These additions help provide a more comprehensive analysis of the ETF data, including return analysis and volatility assessment. Keep in mind that financial data analysis can be complex, and the accuracy of the results heavily depends on the quality of the data and the assumptions made during calculations. It's also important to ensure that your analysis aligns with your specific goals and use cases.
